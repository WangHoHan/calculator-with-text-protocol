# CALCULATOR WITH TEXT PROTOCOL

Project for Network Technologies course on Information Engineering at Poznan University of Technology. The application is in client-server model. Our app allows client to ask server, what is the result of some simple mathematic operation and get back the answer. Server stores the history of computed problems. The exchange of data between computers is based on own text protocol. There is also a documentation attached (please note that the documentation is written in Polish).
